                This research article dives deep into what makes Hoarding OCD uniquely different from OCD without hoarding — looking at symptom severity, gender differences, and co-occurring conditions. It is one of the most detailed scientific studies on the subject.
              </p>

              <p>
                The study, which examined 473 OCD patients, found that hoarders suffered from significantly more severe OCD symptoms — especially compulsions — and had greater impairment and dysphoria, as well as more comorbid psychiatric disorders.
              </p>

              <p>
                It also revealed important gender-based differences, finding that compared to female non-hoarders, female hoarders were more likely to suffer from bipolar disorder, substance abuse, panic disorder, and binge-eating disorder, and had greater OCD severity.
              </p>

              <p>
                This article is particularly useful for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and researchers looking to understand the full clinical picture of hoarding within the context of OCD.
