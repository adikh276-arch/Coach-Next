                This is one of the most thorough and beginner-friendly articles on Pure O OCD available online. Written by OCD specialists, it breaks down what Pure O actually is, how its symptoms differ from classic OCD, and what recovery looks like — making it an ideal starting point for anyone new to understanding this condition.

                The article immediately addresses the most common misconception: Pure OCD is a type of OCD in which a person's compulsions are largely mental or covert. In a study of 225 patients with OCD, 12.9% reported mental compulsions as their main compulsion. Unlike more visible compulsions like checking or handwashing, the rituals in Pure O OCD are often thought-based — with common mental compulsions including reassuring yourself, analyzing memories, or silently repeating phrases to reduce anxiety.

                It also offers a powerful message of hope: ERP therapy works for all OCD subtypes including Pure O, with 80% of people showing significant improvement in their symptoms — making Pure O OCD highly treatable, and early intervention can dramatically improve quality of life.

              <p>
                A must-read for anyone who suspects they may have Pure O or knows someone who does.
