                This is one of the most moving and honest accounts of hoarding OCD ever written. The author, a woman who shared her story at retirement age, describes how her condition built up silently over the years — hidden behind the excuse of a busy work life, while her home slowly turned into what she calls a "clutter maze."
              </p>

              <p>
                She reached a breaking point where she felt that death would be a welcome release. She was depressed, unable to problem-solve, and her doctor was not recognizing her problem — blaming her excessive work habits instead. She began to realize that work was just a wonderful excuse for the clutter and decided she would have to begin searching seriously for an answer herself.
              </p>

              <p>
                The turning point came when she made a phone call and connected with someone who understood OCD. She found a doctor who dealt only with OCD clients. There were no instant cures — she took small steps, saw her doctor twice a week, and worked on assignments he suggested. It took months of work, but her husband started to see changes and she began to laugh again.
              </p>

              <p>
                She reclaimed her home room by room, and her biggest success came in keeping those areas clean and uncluttered.
              </p>

              <p>
                Her message at the end is deeply encouraging — she urges others to start with one small victory at a time and build on those achievements.
