                This open-access review from Rocky Vista University is ideal for anyone wanting a complete, balanced, and accessible overview of both psychological and medication-based treatments for trichotillomania — all in one place.

              <p>
                Trichotillomania is a psychiatric disorder involving chronic, recurrent urges to pull out one's own hair, arising frequently in childhood and early adolescence — predominantly affecting women and carrying a high co-morbidity with many other psychiatric conditions. Currently, the etiology is unknown, which makes treating TTM extremely difficult.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the treatment front, the review is clear about what works best: of the behavioral interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and habit reversal training (HRT) have demonstrated the greatest improvements in hair-pulling severity, with HRT showing the most efficacy for long-term maintenance of progress.
              </p>

              <p>
                The article also points to an exciting direction for future research: future research directions include larger placebo-controlled pharmacological trials, exploring the efficacy of combined behavioral and pharmacological approaches compared to monotherapy, and delving into the potential genetic and neurochemical contributions that may underlie TTM.
