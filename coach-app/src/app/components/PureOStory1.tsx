                Elliot's story is one of the most relatable and honest accounts of Pure O OCD written from a young person's perspective. It captures perfectly the invisible, isolating nature of a condition that leaves no outward trace — while causing enormous inner turmoil.
              </p>

              <p>
                Elliot describes how just existing in their mind was a struggle because of the influx of intrusive thoughts that came from the most random and minor things — and the compulsions they felt they had to perform to "prevent" these thoughts from becoming a reality. Because Pure O, by definition, happens solely internally, no one around them could tell immediately if they were having a difficult time with it — making it a very solitary, isolating experience, with all the stress and panic and fear happening inside their head while no one around had any idea.
              </p>

              <p>
                The turning point came during university, when the pressures of living alone and starting a degree brought everything to the surface. Walking anywhere was challenging because of an obsession with maintaining a sense of symmetry in every step, seeing friends became difficult because every social event was followed by hours of rumination, and the compulsions went from a relatively minor irritation to a constant and draining battle.
              </p>

              <p>
                Elliot's message about recovery is beautifully realistic: recovery, for them, is about reaching a point where OCD is manageable, not where it is gone — and that a lot of dealing with OCD is about learning to manage the stress of obsessions without fulfilling the associated compulsion, which when it comes to Pure O is a purely internal process that can feel much harder because the compulsions are so easy to do — often just a thought — and there is no one to hold you accountable except yourself.
