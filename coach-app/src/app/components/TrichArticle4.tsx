                This is a landmark large-scale study from Sweden — one of the biggest real-world datasets on trichotillomania ever published. It draws from the Swedish National Patient Register and covers over 1,200 diagnosed individuals, offering rare insight into who actually gets this disorder and what their lives look like.
              </p>

              <p>
                Trichotillomania is an understudied, underrecognized, and difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorder that affects about 1–2% of the population, predominantly women. The cohort of 1,234 individuals had a median age at first diagnosis of 25 years, with most individuals being female (85%) and single (82%).
              </p>

              <p>
                The study also reveals just how rarely trichotillomania occurs in isolation. Most individuals (75%) had a comorbid psychiatric disorder diagnosed during the study period — with anxiety-related disorders (65%), depressive disorders (48%), and neurodevelopmental disorders (39%) being the most frequently co-occurring diagnoses.
              </p>

              <p>
                This study is particularly valuable because it moves beyond theoretical models and shows what trichotillomania actually looks like in real populations — making it essential reading for clinicians and policymakers alike.
